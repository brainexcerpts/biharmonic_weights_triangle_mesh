Compute Bi-harmonic weights over a triangle mesh using the Laplacian matrix and cotangent weights.
The result is display with GLUT. 

At the top of main.cpp you can play with hard coded parameters to change sample models or display mode:
- _3d_view
- _b_type
- _sample_path
- etc.
    
Toogle wireframe view with the 'w' key

The crux of the algorithm is in "solve_bilaplacian.cpp"

This also contains code to compute harmonic weights solving the Lapalce equation: "solve_laplace_equation.cpp"
